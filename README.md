#Magnetic Fields Simulator
###What This Is
I was curious in physics class about what magnetic field lines would look like aside from the basic bar magnet diagrams we were shown, so I decided to make my own simulator.

###GUI
There are some basic controls to change the global variable

and also the magnets themselves.

###Examples
Using the simulator you can create cool patterns with the magnets
